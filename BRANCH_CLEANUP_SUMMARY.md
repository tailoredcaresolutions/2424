# Branch Cleanup Implementation Summary

## Task Completed ✅

Created an automated GitHub Actions workflow to delete all branches (except `main`) when a pull request is merged to the main branch.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/cleanup-branches.yml`

This workflow:
- **Triggers**: When a PR to `main` is closed
- **Condition**: Only runs if the PR was actually merged (not just closed)
- **Action**: Deletes all remote branches except `main`
- **Safety**: Uses GitHub token for authentication and handles errors gracefully

### 2. Documentation
**File**: `.github/workflows/README.md`

Comprehensive documentation explaining:
- How the workflow works
- When it triggers
- How to test it
- Troubleshooting steps

## Current Repository State

### Branches Before Merge
- `main` - Production branch (will be preserved)
- `copilot/create-pull-request-method` - Will be deleted after merge
- `copilot/delete-branches-after-merge` - Current branch, will be deleted after merge
- `copilot/request-production-main-branch` - Will be deleted after merge

### Expected State After Merge
- `main` - Only branch remaining

## How to Complete the Task

### Step 1: Create Pull Request
A pull request needs to be created from `copilot/delete-branches-after-merge` to `main`.

**Note**: The system doesn't allow creating PRs via command line, so this needs to be done via GitHub web interface.

### Step 2: Merge the Pull Request
Once the PR is reviewed and approved, merge it to `main`.

### Step 3: Automatic Cleanup
When the PR is merged, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Detect the merge event
2. Fetch all remote branches
3. Delete all branches except `main`
4. Generate a summary report

## Verification

After the merge completes, verify:
1. Check the Actions tab in GitHub to see the workflow run
2. Navigate to the branches page to confirm only `main` remains
3. Review the workflow summary for a list of deleted branches

## Technical Details

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
Trigger: pull_request (closed) on main branch
Condition: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
Permissions: contents: write
Runner: ubuntu-latest
```

### Safety Features
- Only deletes branches when PR is merged (not just closed)
- Preserves the `main` branch
- Handles deletion failures gracefully
- Provides detailed logging and summary

### YAML Validation
✅ Syntax validated with Python YAML parser
✅ Linting passed with yamllint (no errors)

## Next Action Required

Since this automation system cannot directly create pull requests, the next step must be performed manually:

**Create a Pull Request** from branch `copilot/delete-branches-after-merge` to `main` via the GitHub web interface at:
https://github.com/tailoredcaresolutions/2424/compare/main...copilot/delete-branches-after-merge

Once merged, the workflow will automatically execute and clean up all branches except `main`.
