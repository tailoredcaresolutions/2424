```bash
# Test Case 1: Basic Shift Documentation
Input: "Hello, I am documenting my shift with Mrs. Johnson today. 
        She had breakfast at 8am and took her medications."
        
Response Time: ~2 seconds (llama3.2:3b fallback)
Status: ✅ SUCCESS

Output:
{
  "response": "Mrs. Johnson had breakfast at 8am and took her medications as observed...",
  "noteText": "Mrs. Johnson had breakfast at 8am and took her medications as observed...",
  "dar": {...},
  "emotionalTone": "empathetic"
}
```

**Test Case 2: Critical Observation (Pain Report)**

```bash
Input: "The client complained of pain in her right knee, rated 7 out of 10. 
        I notified the supervisor immediately."
        
Response Time: ~30 seconds (llama3.3:70b)
Status: ✅ SUCCESS

Output:
{
  "response": "Mrs. Smith reported experiencing pain in her right knee, 
               rating it a 7 out of 10...",
  "dar": {
    "notify_supervisor_RN": true,
    "reason": "client reported significant pain"
  }
}
```

**✅ PASS:** AI correctly identified need to notify supervisor for pain complaint.

---

### 2. Report Generation ✅ PASS

**Test:** Generate complete DAR report from shift data

```bash
POST /api/generate-ai-report

Input: Complete shift data with observations, care activities, client responses
Response Time: ~5 seconds
Status: ✅ SUCCESS

Output:
{
  "success": true,
  "noteText": "PERSONAL SUPPORT WORKER SHIFT REPORT...",
  "dar": {
    "client_name": "Mrs. Johnson",
    "date_time": "2025-10-24T16:41:04.369Z",
    "DAR": {
      "Data": "Client had breakfast at 8am...",
      "Action": "Assisted with personal care...",
      "Response": "Client was cooperative..."
    },
    "adls": {...},
    "observations": {...}
  }
}
```

**✅ PASS:** Complete DAR report generated with proper structure.
