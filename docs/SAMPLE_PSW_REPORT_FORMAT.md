## EXAMPLE 1: Morning Shift Report

### Raw Voice Input (PSW Speaking):

> "Good morning, this is Sarah reporting for my shift with client Margaret Chen, client ID MC-2847. I arrived at 7 AM. Margaret was already awake and in good spirits this morning, she was sitting up in bed watching the news. I helped her with her morning routine - we did a bed bath since she said she was feeling a bit tired for a full shower today. No issues with personal care. She was cooperative and chatty.
>
> For breakfast she had oatmeal with banana slices, toast with jam, and orange juice. She ate everything, really enjoyed the meal. Took her morning medications without any problems - that's the blood pressure pill and the vitamin D.
>
> After breakfast I helped her get dressed. She wanted to wear her blue cardigan today because her daughter is visiting this afternoon and that's her favorite. We transferred from bed to wheelchair using the lift, everything went smoothly, no pain or discomfort reported.
>
> I wheeled her to the common room where she sat with her friend Dorothy. They were working on a puzzle together and talking about the old days. Margaret seemed really happy. Her mood was great all morning.
>
> Bathroom - she used the commode twice during my shift, continent both times, no issues. I helped with transfers. Skin check looked good, no redness or pressure points. Vital signs taken at 10 AM: blood pressure 128 over 82, pulse 76, temperature 98.2. All normal.
>
> She asked me to remind her daughter to bring the photo album when she visits. I made a note in the communication book. That's all for my morning shift, ending at 11 AM."

## EXAMPLE 2: Afternoon Shift with Concerns

### Raw Voice Input:

> "Hi, this is Michael, reporting for client John Davis, ID JD-1923, afternoon shift 2 to 6 PM. When I arrived John was in his room, sitting in his chair but he seemed really quiet today, not his usual self. Asked him how he was doing and he said he was okay but I could tell something was off.
>
> He didn't want lunch, said he wasn't hungry. I tried to encourage him to at least have some soup or crackers but he only had a few bites of a sandwich and maybe half a cup of water. That's unusual for him, he usually has a good appetite.
>
> Helped him to the bathroom around 2:30. He's been going more frequently today - this was his third time since my shift started two hours ago. Urine looked a bit dark. I noted that. He complained about feeling a bit uncomfortable 'down there' but couldn't really describe it more than that.
>
> Took his vitals at 3 PM - temperature was 99.1, a bit elevated. Blood pressure was 142 over 88, little higher than normal. Pulse was 82. He said he felt a bit warm.
>
> He didn't want to go to activities this afternoon, just wanted to stay in his room and rest. I got him comfortable in bed, he napped for about an hour. When he woke up around 4:30 he still seemed tired. Offered him a snack and juice, he drank some apple juice but didn't want to eat.
>
> I checked with the nurse, Rachel, around 4:45 about the frequent urination and the elevated temp. She's going to come assess him before end of shift. I stayed with him until she arrived.
>
> Just concerned because this is definitely different from his normal behavior. He's usually social and chatty and has good appetite. Today he's withdrawn and not eating much. Shift ends at 6 PM, nurse arrived at 5:45 for assessment."

## EXAMPLE 3: Multilingual Client Report

### Raw Voice Input:

> "Hi, this is Chen reporting, evening shift for Mrs. Maria Rodriguez, ID MR-5621, 6 PM to 10 PM. Mrs. Rodriguez was speaking mostly Spanish today, which is normal for her in the evenings. Her daughter Rosa called at 6:30 and they talked for about 20 minutes, that really cheered her up.
>
> For dinner she had chicken with rice and beans, flan for dessert. Ate about 75% of the meal, said it reminded her of her mother's cooking. We talked about her childhood in Puerto Rico while she was eating, she was very animated telling me stories in Spanish. I understand enough to follow along.
>
> After dinner I helped her with her evening routine. Changed into her nightgown, helped her wash up and brush her teeth. She likes to do her own hair brushing, says it's important to her. Transferred to bed using the walker, she's pretty steady on her feet with it.
>
> We watched a Spanish-language novela together for a bit, she loves that show. She was laughing and commenting on the drama. At 8:30 she said she was tired and wanted to lie down. I helped her get comfortable in bed, gave her the TV remote and her water bottle.
>
> Evening medications at 9 PM - blood pressure pill and the calcium tablet. No problems. Checked on her at 9:30 before I left, she was drowsy, watching TV quietly. Call bell within reach, water on the table. Told her I'd see her tomorrow evening. She said 'Gracias, mi hija' - that means 'thank you, my daughter' - she's very sweet. Shift ended 10 PM, she was settling in for sleep."
