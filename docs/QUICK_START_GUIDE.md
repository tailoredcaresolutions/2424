## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Avatar Not Animating
**Problem:** Avatar appears but doesn't breathe or pulse
**Solution:**
1. Check if "Reduce Motion" is enabled in system settings
2. If yes, animations are intentionally disabled (accessibility)
3. If no, try refreshing the page

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working
**Problem:** Pressing ? or Space does nothing
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're NOT focused on a text input
2. Click outside any input field
3. Try pressing ? again
4. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser

### Microphone Not Working
**Problem:** Can't start voice recording
**Solution:**
1. Check browser permissions (should prompt on first use)
2. iOS Safari: Use text mode instead (limited voice API support)
3. Ensure microphone is connected and working
4. Try refreshing and granting permissions again

### Typing Dots Not Appearing
**Problem:** Old spinner still shows instead of dots
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Ensure latest code is deployed

### "Your Turn" Badge Not Appearing
**Problem:** Badge never shows even after multiple AI messages
**Solution:**
1. This is expected - badge only shows after 2-3 consecutive AI messages
2. If you respond after each AI message, badge won't appear
3. This is correct behavior (turn-taking is working!)
