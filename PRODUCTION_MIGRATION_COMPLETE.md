# Always verify directory
pwd
# Expected: /Volumes/AI/psw-reporting-production
```

#### ✅ Checkpoint 2: Mid-Phase (50% Complete)
- Verify still in production directory
- Check for duplicate files
- Test changes
- Review console for errors

#### ✅ Checkpoint 3: Before Completing Phase
- Final directory verification
- All files in correct locations
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated

#### ✅ Checkpoint 4: Before Any File Operation
- Run `pwd` to confirm location
- Verify target path includes production directory
- Check for file conflicts
- Backup if modifying existing files
