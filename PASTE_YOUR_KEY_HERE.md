# ðŸŽ¯ QUICK START: Add Your V0 API Key

## WHERE TO PASTE YOUR KEY

Open this file:
```
/Volumes/AI/psw-reporting-production/.env.local
```

Find line 10 (near the top):
```bash
V0_API_KEY=your_v0_api_key_here
```

Replace with your actual key:
```bash
V0_API_KEY=v0_sk_your_actual_key_here
```

**That's it!** Save the file and I can start generating components for you! âœ¨

## TEST IT WORKS

After adding your key, run:
```bash
node scripts/generate-v0-component.js "Create a button with loading state"
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Component generated successfully!
ðŸ“¦ To add this component to your project:
   v0 add abc123xyz
```

---

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Once your key is added:

1. **I can generate components** - Just tell me what you need
2. **You get component IDs** - To install with `v0 add <id>`
3. **Components appear in** `components/ui/`
4. **Ready to use** in your React code!

### Example:
**You say**: "I need a quality toggle for 14B, 30B, and 72B models"

**I do**:
```bash
node scripts/generate-v0-component.js "Create a radio group with three options..."
```

**You get**:
```
Component ID: abc123xyz
Run: v0 add abc123xyz
```

**Done!** Component in `components/ui/quality-toggle.tsx`
