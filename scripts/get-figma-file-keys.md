## ‚úÖ How to Get File Keys

### Method 1: From Figma File URL

1. Open your Figma file in browser
2. Look at the URL:
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/file/FILE_KEY_HERE/File-Name
   ```
3. The `FILE_KEY_HERE` is what you need!

### Method 2: From File Browser

1. In Figma, right-click on a file
2. Select "Copy link"
3. The link contains the file key:
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/file/abc123xyz456/My-File-Name
   ```
   ‚Üí File key: `abc123xyz456`

### Method 3: Share Multiple File Keys

If you have multiple files, share them like this:
```bash
FIGMA_FILE_KEYS=abc123,def456,ghi789
```

Or add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Comma-separated list of file keys
FIGMA_FILE_KEYS=your_file_key_1,your_file_key_2,your_file_key_3
```
