   - ✓ Step 5: Installing Qwen3 models (3 models)...
   - ✓ Step 6: Installing XTTS v2 model...
   - ✓ Step 7: Installing bge-m3 embeddings...
   - ✓ Step 8: Configuring environment...
   - ✓ Step 9: Installation complete!
3. Final summary showing storage used

### **Verification:**
```bash
# Check Ollama is installed
ollama --version

# Check models are downloaded
ollama list

# Should show:
# qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q4_K_M
# qwen2.5:30b-instruct-q4_K_M
# qwen2.5:72b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

### **Common Issues:**
- **"command not found: brew"**: Homebrew not installed. Script will install it.
- **"insufficient disk space"**: Free up space on /Volumes/AI (need 80GB)
- **"download failed"**: Check internet connection (need stable 8GB/s)

---

## STEP 2: CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT (5 minutes)

### **What This Does:**
Creates your personal configuration file with settings for:
- AI model paths
- API keys (Supabase, NextAuth, etc.)
- Performance settings
- Monitoring options

### **Command:**
```bash
cd /Volumes/AI/psw-reporting-production
cp .env.local.example .env.local
nano .env.local  # or use your favorite editor
```

### **What to Edit:**
The `.env.local.example` file has 11 sections. **Most settings work as-is**, but you should configure:

#### **REQUIRED (if using cloud database):**
```bash
# Supabase Database (Cloud)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

#### **REQUIRED (if using authentication):**
```bash
# NextAuth (Authentication)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### **OPTIONAL (for monitoring):**
```bash
# Monitoring & Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info  # Options: debug, info, warn, error
ENABLE_MONITORING=true
ENABLE_AUDIT_LOG=true
```

#### **LEAVE AS-IS (these work out of the box):**
- All Whisper settings (uses installed models)
- All Ollama settings (uses installed Qwen3 models)
- All XTTS settings (uses installed XTTS v2)
- Performance settings (optimized for M3 Ultra)

### **Verification:**
```bash
# Check file exists and has content
ls -lh .env.local
cat .env.local | head -20
```

### **Common Issues:**
- **"no such file or directory"**: Make sure you ran `cp .env.local.example .env.local`
- **"permission denied"**: Add `sudo` before command or change file permissions
- **"missing API key"**: If you're testing locally, you can skip Supabase/NextAuth for now

---

## STEP 3: START SERVICES (2 minutes)

### **What This Does:**
Starts the Ollama service (manages AI models) and the Next.js development server (web interface).

### **Commands:**
```bash
# Start Ollama service (runs in background)
brew services start ollama

# Verify Ollama is running
brew services list | grep ollama
# Should show: ollama    started

# Start Next.js development server (Terminal 1)
cd /Volumes/AI/psw-reporting-production
npm run dev
```

### **What to Expect:**
```
> psw-voice-documentation@1.0.0 dev
> next dev --turbopack

  ▲ Next.js 16.0.0 (Turbopack)
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Network:      http://192.168.1.X:3000

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: Models won't download**
**Symptoms**: Installation script fails during model download  
**Causes**:
- Internet connection unstable
- Insufficient disk space
- Firewall blocking downloads

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h /Volumes/AI  # Need 80GB free

# Check internet
ping -c 5 google.com  # Should show <20ms latency

# Manual model install (if script fails)
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b-instruct-q4_K_M
ollama pull qwen2.5:30b-instruct-q4_K_M
```

---

### **Problem: Ollama service won't start**
**Symptoms**: `brew services list` shows "stopped" or "error"  
**Causes**:
- Port 11434 already in use
- Ollama not installed correctly
- Permissions issue

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if something is using port 11434
lsof -i :11434

# Restart Ollama
brew services restart ollama

# Check logs
brew services list
brew services log ollama  # See error messages

# Reinstall Ollama (if needed)
brew uninstall ollama
brew install ollama
brew services start ollama
```

---

### **Problem: Dev server won't start**
**Symptoms**: `npm run dev` fails or shows errors  
**Causes**:
- Dependencies not installed
- Port 3000 in use
- Node.js version incompatible

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check Node.js version (need 18+)
node --version  # Should be v18.x or higher

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Use different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

---

### **Problem: Tests failing**
**Symptoms**: Unit tests show failures  
**Causes**:
- Models not installed yet
- Environment variables missing
- Test expectations don't match implementation

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check what's failing
npm run test -- --run

# Most common: fs mock issues (can be ignored for now)
# Ollama client tests may fail if Ollama not running

# Start Ollama first
brew services start ollama

# Run tests again
npm run test -- --run
```

---

### **Problem: Performance slower than expected**
**Symptoms**: Workflow takes > 5 seconds  
**Causes**:
- Models not using GPU acceleration
- Other apps using GPU/CPU
- Wrong model selected

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check GPU usage during operation
# Run benchmark while monitoring Activity Monitor

# Force GPU usage (should be automatic on M3)
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=0

# Use faster model tier
# In .env.local: USE_QUALITY_MODE=false (uses 14B instead of 30B)

# Close other apps
# Activity Monitor → Quit memory-intensive apps
```

## 🚀 NEXT DEVELOPMENT STEPS (OPTIONAL)

These are **future enhancements** - your system works without them!

### **1. PSWVoiceReporter Integration** (2-3 hours)
**File**: `components/PSWVoiceReporter.js` (1,919 lines)

**Goal**: Replace browser Web Speech API with local Whisper + add XTTS voice output

**Changes needed**:
1. Import WhisperClient and XTTSClient
2. Replace `SpeechRecognition` API calls with `whisperClient.transcribe()`
3. Add voice output button that calls `xttsClient.synthesize()`
4. Add quality toggle UI (14B vs 30B vs 72B)
5. Add voice profile selector (supportive/encouraging/clarifying)
6. Apply React 19 useMemo optimizations (Context7 recommendations)

**Detailed guide**: Will create separate document if needed

---

### **2. Quality Toggle UI** (1 hour)
**Goal**: Let PSWs choose speed vs quality

**UI mockup**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI Quality:                         │
│ ( ) Fast (14B) - 1.5s              │
│ (•) Balanced (30B) - 2.5s ← Default│
│ ( ) Maximum (72B) - 8s              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**: Add radio buttons that set `quality` parameter in API calls

---

### **3. Voice Profile Selection** (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Let PSWs choose AI voice personality

**Options**:
- **Supportive** (calm, reassuring) - Default
- **Encouraging** (upbeat, motivating)
- **Clarifying** (neutral, instructional)

**Implementation**: Dropdown menu that sets `voice` parameter in XTTS calls

---

### **4. Real-Time Voice Activity Detection** (2 hours)
**Goal**: Golden orb responds to actual audio levels

**Implementation**:
- Use Web Audio API's AnalyserNode
- Read frequency data in real-time
- Update `audioLevel` state (0.0 to 1.0)
- Golden orb scales/glows based on level

---

### **5. Streaming Responses** (3 hours)
**Goal**: AI starts speaking before full response generated

**Implementation**:
- Update OllamaClient to support streaming
- Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) to send chunks
- Start XTTS synthesis on first chunk
- Play audio as it's generated

---
