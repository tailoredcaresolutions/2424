## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feature/multi-language-support`
- `fix/voice-recording-timeout`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for new files when possible
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use functional components and React Hooks
- Avoid `any` types in TypeScript
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Best Practices

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed to child components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow brand color palette:
  - Navy: `#1B365D`
  - Gold: `#D4A574`
- Use CSS variables defined in `globals.css`
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)

### File Organization

- Place components in `components/`
- Place utilities in `lib/`
- Place API routes in `app/api/`
- Place page components in `app/`
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible

---

## Testing Requirements

Write unit tests for:
- Utility functions
- Business logic
- Custom hooks
- API route handlers

```bash
# Run unit tests

```

### E2E Tests

Write E2E tests for:
- Critical user flows
- Form submissions
- Navigation
- API integrations

```bash
# Run E2E tests

## Security Guidelines

### Never Commit Secrets

- Use `.env.local` for local secrets (ignored by git)
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Run `git secrets` scan before pushing

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Sanitize HTML to prevent XSS
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use NextAuth.js for authentication
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions
- Use bcrypt or Argon2id for password hashing
- Implement proper session management

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Review security advisories
- Only add necessary dependencies

---

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- Use JSDoc for functions and components
- Explain "why" not "what" in comments
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Document complex algorithms or business logic

### README Updates

Update README.md when adding:
- New features
- New dependencies
- Configuration changes
- Deployment steps

### API Documentation

Document all API endpoints with:
