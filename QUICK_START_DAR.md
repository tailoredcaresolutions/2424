## 🚀 Try It Now

### Option 1: Demo Page (Recommended for Testing)
**URL**: http://localhost:3000/demo-dar

1. Visit the demo page
2. Select language (English, Filipino, Spanish, etc.)
3. Type a PSW narrative (e.g., "Helped Margaret with breakfast. She ate 75% of her meal...")
4. Click **Generate**
5. See paragraph + JSON
6. Try **Copy Paragraph**, **Show DAR JSON**, **Copy JSON**, **Export JSON**

### Option 2: Main Application
**URL**: http://localhost:3000

1. Use the voice interface as normal
2. After generating a report, look for new buttons:
   - **🔍 View DAR JSON** - Toggle to show structured data
   - **📥 Export JSON** - Download as `.dar.json` file
   - **📋 Copy JSON** - Copy to clipboard

## 📊 What Gets Generated?

### Paragraph Note (Human-Readable)
```
Margaret Smith was alert and oriented during the morning shift.
Assisted with hygiene routine and dressing. Client stated "Thank
you dear, you're so helpful" and appeared comfortable throughout
care. Breakfast consumed independently with good appetite.
```

### DAR JSON (Structured Data)
```json
{
  "client_name": "Margaret Smith",
  "date_time": "2025-10-24T10:30:00Z",
  "language": "en",
  "DAR": {
    "Data": "Client alert and oriented. Skin dry on lower legs.",
    "Action": "Assisted with hygiene and dressing. Walked to dining room.",
    "Response": "Client thanked PSW, smiled, ate most of breakfast."
  },
  "adls": {
    "personal_care": "Assisted with hygiene needs",
    "mobility": "Ambulatory with assistance",
    "nutrition": {
      "meal": "breakfast",
      "intake": "most",
      "items": ["toast", "eggs", "juice"]
    }
  },
  "follow_up": {
    "notify_supervisor_RN": false
  },
  "psw_id": "Sarah Johnson"
}
```

## 🎓 Training Tips

### For PSWs
1. The JSON is **automatic** - you don't need to do anything different
2. Your paragraph note is still the main documentation
3. JSON is for **system integration** and **structured reporting**
4. Export JSON if required by your supervisor or EHR system

### For Supervisors
1. JSON provides **structured data** for analytics and reporting
2. Easier to **search** and **filter** than plain text
3. **Consistent format** across all PSWs
4. Export to Excel/database for analysis

### For Administrators
1. JSON enables **automated compliance checking**
2. Integrates with **EHR systems** more easily
3. Supports **audit trails** and reporting
4. Reduces manual data entry

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Demo page won't load"
**Solution**: Make sure dev server is running
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "API returns error"
**Solution**: Check server logs in terminal
```bash
# Server should show: 🏠 Running in LOCAL MODE
```

### Issue: "JSON looks wrong"
**Solution**: This is expected in local mode. Full AI parsing requires OpenAI API key.

### Issue: "Export button doesn't work"
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Make sure JavaScript is enabled.
